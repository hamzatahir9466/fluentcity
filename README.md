# Fluent City Coding Challenge

### The Challenge
Write a function that takes an english word as an input and checks if the word exists in a dictionary of words (provided via the `dictionary.txt` file). If the word exists in the dictionary then return all valid anagrams of that word sorted alphabetically by its second letter. If the word does not exist in the dictionary then return `None`.

Note that you should make liberal use of code comments explaining your thinking throughout the code. I would go so far as to say that you should think of this project as half code challenge, half written essay. Types of thoughts worth including in the comments are:

- Explanations behind why you chose the approach you did
- Applicable design principles you think are pertinent to this challenge
- Problem areas or future concerns (e.g. how might the code scale in production)
- Alternative implementations/approaches you considered but did not use
- How you might have approached things differently if you had weeks of build time
- How you might approach things differently if the source dictionary had a billion words
- Why you wrote the unit tests you did and what they guard against
- Your personal opinions about best practices or philosophies that lead to quality code
- Anything else you can think of that might better explain your thoughts, feelings, and opinions about the art of programming and how those ideas might apply to this particular challenge.

### Notes

- We prefer the code to be written Python 3 or ES6, but any language will do
- Please include unit tests for testing your application
- Use any 3rd party library that you would like to use as long as you can explain the "why" behind your choices
- The words in the dictionary.txt file can be stored and accessed in any way you like. You need not restrict your program to read from the file directly.
- please upload your final project to [Github](https://github.com/), and develop in a way that includes the full commit history
- Use as many commits as you feel necessary and rebase or squash any commits that you feel are not useful after your development is complete.
- Finally, feel free to email us at any point if you have questions or need clarification.

### Bonus

- Optimize for speed
- Feel free to add any extra features not included in the instuctions that you feel might best show off what you can do. The feature can be useful or ridiculous/fun so long as at illustrates an engineering quality. So for example you might do the anagram lookup via an AJAX request that hits an API endpoint, build a UI, focus on optimization, UX, animation, etc. Every lookup could come with a Google image search that returns pictures of kittens. The sky is the limit basically.
